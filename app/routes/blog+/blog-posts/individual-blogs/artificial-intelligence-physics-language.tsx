          In a captivating video discussion, Dustin Carr, a Ph.D. physicist with
          a background in sensors, nanofabrication, and photonics, joins Evan
          Marie Carr, a skilled web developer and musician, to delve into the
          intriguing connections between artificial intelligence, quantum
          physics, and language.
        </p>
        <p>
          The conversation begins by highlighting the current limitations of AI
          systems, particularly those relying on Large Language Models (LLMs).
          Dustin explains that LLMs perform a series of computations, processing
          input context through multiple layers to generate output tokens one at
          a time. He emphasizes that while LLMs can form a model of the universe
          based on the input data, they lack the constant cycling and refinement
          of information that occurs within the human mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evan raises the question of how AI can bridge the gap between its
          current capabilities and the incredible power of human cognition.
          Dustin suggests that the answer lies in understanding the fundamental
          differences between artificial and human intelligence, such as the
          static nature of LLM training and the lack of online learning in AI
          systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          The discussion then shifts to the potential parallels between physics
          and language. Dustin proposes that language, like information and
          computation, may have physical properties that can be understood
          through the lens of physics. He believes that by applying the tools
          and concepts developed in physics over the past few centuries, we can
          gain deeper insights into the nature of language and its relationship
          to the physical world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evan wonders if the seemingly instantaneous transmission of
          information between photons separated by vast distances could shed
          light on the connection between the physical and non-physical realms.
          Dustin suggests that this phenomenon may indicate the illusory nature
          of space and time, hinting at a deeper underlying reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          The conversation concludes with a thought-provoking idea: physics must
          extend its scope to encompass the insubstantial world, including the
          realms of spirituality and consciousness. By bringing the tools and
          insights of physics to bear on these domains, we may uncover
          fundamental truths about the nature of reality and the role of
          language within it.
        </p>
        <p>
          This engaging dialogue between Dustin and Evan invites viewers to
          ponder the profound implications of the intersections between AI,
          quantum physics, and language. As our understanding of these fields
          continues to evolve, it is clear that there is much to be discovered
          at the frontiers of human knowledge.
