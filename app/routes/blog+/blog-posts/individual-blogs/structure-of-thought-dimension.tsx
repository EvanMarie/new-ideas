        <h3>2. The Structure of the Thought Dimension</h3>
        <p>
          In this section, we delve into the quantum-like properties of the
          thought dimension, exploring how the dynamics of mental processes and
          the behavior of quantum systems can be understood as analogous. We
          propose that thoughts and words exhibit bosonic properties, while
          individual beings are more akin to fermions. We also discuss the
          implications of quantum entanglement and communication within the
          thought dimension and how these phenomena may manifest in the physical
          world.
        </p>

        <h3>2.1 Thoughts and words as bosons</h3>
        <p>
          Bosons, such as photons and gluons, are particles that can occupy the
          same quantum state simultaneously, exhibiting collective behavior and
          coherence (Bose, 1924). The reason for this is that the individual
          bosons are indistinguishable from others of the same kind. For
          instance, if a thought existed in the minds of two individual people
          at the same time, we could interchange those two thoughts without any
          meaningful or detectable change occurring in the universe. This simple
          feature of boson particles enables a wide range of phenomena that are
          important in our current technological world, including lasers and
          superconductivity. In the thought dimension, we propose that thoughts
          and words can be understood as analogous to bosons, displaying similar
          properties of collective behavior and coherence.
        </p>

        <h4>2.1.1 The fundamental Axiom</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Present time thought awareness in a living being is the only place
            from which all known phenomena arise and/or terminate.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          This is an axiomatic statement, and it is fundamentally non-dual. It
          is axiomatic in that it is a formative description of the universe.
          Rather than the big bang, it is this, always and forever, from which
          the universe unfolds. A continuous stream of awareness that is always
          at the present moment is the place where the universe is both created
          and destroyed. None of this takes away from the observations of
          science. We merely note that science has had a tendency to extrapolate
          into areas for matters of theoretical convenience, and often times
          scientists confuse these extrapolations with reality. This has been
          true since the time of Pythagoras or earlier. This is only problematic
          if the extrapolations turn into a very non-scientific form of dogma.
        </p>
        <p>
          These extrapolations can outlive their usefulness as new observations
          are brought to bear. The observations of quantum mechanics a century
          ago revealed that models of an objective universe were fundamentally
          flawed. We are still unraveling the message that quantum mechanics has
          delivered to us, and the concept that it is settled science is readily
          disputed by all physicists, even as it is the most accurate and
          complete physical theory that has ever been devised. What holds us
          back from integrating its conclusions may very well be our hanging
          onto illusory extrapolations that no longer fit the data observed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The above axiom can be summed up in a more relatable converse: "There
          has never been a single verifiable event that has occurred in this
          universe which has not resulted in a thought of some form at some
          moment in time by some living entity." While this concept borrows from
          existentialism, solipsism, and biocentrism, it is still distinct in
          that it ties these together into terms that enable a possible
          unification of the metaphysical and physical realms, something that
          would dramatically affect our understandings across the sciences, both
          hard and soft.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will go further and state that the difference between thoughts and
          sensations is a superficial one that is largely based upon frequency
          domain considerations. There is a certain frequency whereby the
          transmission of information is ill-suited to verbal thoughts and can
          take different forms. Images and sounds are good examples of these.
          Sound is just a vibration. We can track and contemplate something that
          is moving up to a rate of about 10 cycles per second. Above that
          frequency, our minds replace this with a meta-concept called sound,
          and our physical structure supports this transition with the intricate
          device called the ear. The output of the ear is a sequence of
          thought-forms that are used to produce our awareness of the universe.
        </p>
        <p>
          The eye similarly produces sensory inputs that are compiled into
          thoughts about a 3D universe, one which the eyes presumably inhabit.
          The image and the thought of the image are one and the same thing. An
          image is an experience that cannot be separated from the person
          experiencing it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thoughts are the totality of a living entity and thus the primary
          building block of the cosmos. That thoughts from separate entities
          come together and share a universe with other living individuals is
          something highly non-trivial. This does not, a priori, imply the
          existence of something that is independent of all of these thoughts.
          The universe IS the agreement of the thoughts. Nothing more can be
          said about it. Based upon all things we know about quantum mechanics,
          there is insufficient basis to ever say that the universe needs to be
          something that exists independently of these thoughts.
        </p>

        <h3>2.2 Individual beings as fermions</h3>
        <p>
          In contrast to the bosonic nature of thoughts, words, and meaning, we
          propose that individual beings can be understood as analogous to
          fermions, such as electrons and quarks. Fermions are particles that
          obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two fermions
          can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously (Pauli, 1925). While
          thoughts can be interchanged without altering the state of the
          universe, no two living entities can be seen as fully interchangeable
          without an energetic reorganization of the spaces they occupy. That
          has profound implications for the statistical mechanics of living
          entities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just to mention in passing, this points to the idea that there can
          never be any notion of true equality between two individuals. To be
          different is to be alive. The manner of such difference cannot be
          dictated across any dimension, as any attempt to constrain life in
          such a manner will ultimately be seen as an attempt to end life,
          something that life is quite abhorrent to experiencing.
        </p>

        <h4>2.2.1 Unique, non-overlapping identities</h4>
        <p>
          The fermionic nature of individual beings implies that each person
          possesses a unique, non-overlapping identity within the thought
          dimension. This identity arises from the specific configuration of
          thoughts, ideas, and experiences that constitute an individual's
          mental "cloud."
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as fermions are characterized by their distinct quantum numbers,
          such as spin and charge, individual beings can be characterized by
          their unique combinations of personality traits, memories, and
          cognitive abilities (Eysenck, 1967). These characteristics define the
          "quantum state" of an individual within the thought dimension,
          determining their interactions with other beings and their role in the
          collective dynamics of the thought dimension.
        </p>
        <p>
          We hypothesize that the manner in which this occurs is consistent with
          quantum mechanics, projected into the dimension of thought. Note that
          we use the concept "dimension of thought" to describe something which
          may indeed prove to be a multiplicity of dimensions, but it is at the
          very least a single independent dimension. We also do not pretend to
          have defined an adequate metric for this dimension as would be
          required to develop a complete quantum theory involving it. However,
          we are free to use our imagination in the process of scientific
          conjecture, veritably using thought as a bridge to get us from our
          current understanding to the place where we can all expect to end up.
          It is up to the reader to help define and bear witness to that place.
        </p>

        <h4>
          2.2.2 Personal mental "clouds" of thoughts, ideas, and experiences
        </h4>
        <p>
          The fermionic nature of individual beings suggests that each person's
          mental landscape can be understood as a complex, multi-dimensional
          "cloud" of thoughts, ideas, and experiences. This cloud represents the
          probabilistic distribution of an individual's mental states. What this
          means is that the thoughts that exist as part of an entity, as far as
          other entities are concerned, are all virtual. The thoughts can be
          emitted through communication that is mediated by other dimensions,
          but ultimately reaches the thought dimension of another being.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is possible to emit thoughts into the physical dimension, as spoken
          or written language for example, and these thoughts and words may or
          may not ever interact with another being, even if the being comes in
          direct contact with the thoughts and words. This will happen if the
          being that receives the physical communication has no interacting
          states that can be influenced by the message being conveyed (e.g. a
          complete ignorance of the symbols).
        </p>
        <p>
          Other individuals will have the necessary existing thought patterns
          that enable them to integrate the new information in some way,
          resulting in a change in the thought population of the individual.
          This can lead to this individual spontaneously emitting that same
          thought again at a later time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The probability of this spontaneous emission will be affected by the
          present time environment of the individual, and if there are other
          similar thoughts present in the individual's contextual environment,
          then this emission becomes more likely. The words chosen here are
          intentional to cast this into terms that make the entire process
          appear quite similar to what is known and observed among bosons and
          fermions in the physical realm.
        </p>

        <h3>
          2.3 Quantum entanglement and communication in the thought dimension
        </h3>
        <p>
          The quantum-like nature of the thought dimension also implies the
          existence of quantum entanglement and non-local communication between
          individual beings. These phenomena, which are well-established in the
          realm of quantum physics (Bell, 1964; Aspect et al., 1982), can
          provide a basis for understanding the apparent non-local connections
          between individuals, such as telepathy, empathy, and collective
          consciousness.
        </p>

        <h4>2.3.1 Non-local connections between individuals</h4>
        <p>
          Quantum entanglement occurs when two or more particles become
          correlated in such a way that their quantum states cannot be described
          independently, even when they are separated by large distances
          (Einstein, Podolsky, & Rosen, 1935). In the thought dimension, we
          propose that individual beings can become entangled through shared
          experiences, emotional bonds, or even genetic or morphogenetic
          connections (Sheldrake, 2009).
        </p>
        <p>
          These entangled states can give rise to non-local correlations between
          individuals, allowing for the instantaneous transmission of
          information or influence across the thought dimension. This may
          manifest as the seemingly spontaneous emergence of shared ideas or
          synchronicities between individuals who are physically separated
          (Jung, 1952).
        </p>

        <h4>
          2.3.2 Instantaneous transmission of ideas, emotions, and intentions
        </h4>
        <p>
          The non-local nature of quantum entanglement in the thought dimension
          suggests that ideas, emotions, and intentions can be transmitted
          instantaneously between entangled individuals. This transmission
          occurs through the "hidden variables" or "implicate order" of the
          thought dimension (Bohm, 1980), bypassing the limitations of classical
          communication and causality.
        </p>
        <p>
          The instantaneous transmission of mental states through quantum
          entanglement can be understood as a form of "quantum teleportation"
          (Bennett et al., 1993), where the quantum state of one individual's
          mental cloud is transferred to another individual without traversing
          the intervening physical space. This may provide a basis for
          understanding phenomena such as telepathy, empathy, and the
          "transmission" of ideas or emotions between individuals (Radin, 2006).
          The potential mechanisms for this process will be described in more
          detail later.
        </p>

        <p>
          The quantum-like structure of the thought dimension, with its bosonic
          thoughts and words and fermionic individual beings, provides a rich
          framework for understanding the complex dynamics of mental processes
          and their relationship to the physical world. By incorporating
          concepts from quantum mechanics, such as entanglement and
          non-locality, this framework offers new insights into the nature of
          consciousness, the emergence of collective phenomena, and the
          potential for mind-matter interactions.
        </p>

        <p>
          In future chapters, we will explore how this quantum-inspired
          structure of the thought dimension interacts with the physical world
          through the brain as a quantum interface device and how it relates to
          the concepts of morphogenesis and the collective unconscious. By
          integrating these ideas, we aim to develop a comprehensive model of
          reality that bridges the gap between mind and matter and provides a
          new foundation for understanding the nature of consciousness and its
          role in shaping the universe.
