      <h2>
        Calling all TECHY WOMEN - The Evolving Landscape of Women in Artificial
        Intelligence
      </h2>
      <p>
        Greetings, my AI peeps and other really cool individuals! Today, I'm
        excited to share some thoughts on a topic that's not only fascinating
        but also deeply personal to me: the role of women in the rapidly
        evolving field of artificial intelligence.
      </p>
      <h3>A Personal Awakening</h3>
      <p>
        Before we delve into the facts and figures, I want to share a recent
        experience that truly opened my eyes to the power and potential of women
        in AI. Just this morning, I attended my first meeting of a group called
        Women in AI, and it was quite eye-opening.
      </p>
      <p>
        As someone who's been to countless tech networking events, I'm used to
        being one of the few women in a sea of men. I am fine with that. It has
        never been an issue at all. I have enjoyed and learned from every
        experience I have had. However, there was a stark contrast with the
        crowd today.
      </p>

        alt="Women In Ai - Kickoff Meetup"
      />
      <p>
        Imagine walking into a room filled with bright, excited, energetic,
        curious, and fun women, all passionate about AI. Honestly, I never
        really felt like I found my "girl group" in this world. And I have been
        on the planet for a few years now. It has been kind of lonely. But
        today, I think I found my girls. And they are as enthusiastic as I am.
        And I. LOVE. IT.
      </p>
      <p>
        The energy was palpable, the conversations were inspiring, and not only
        did it exceed my expectations, it gave me a whole new perspective on my
        role. Honestly, it made me see my LIFE differently.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then it dawned on me, as I pondered the experience shortly after,
        how the work that Dustin Carr and I do at DarkViolet.ai is all under the
        watchful eye of Dark Violet. She's our logo, our muse, and more—this
        young girl with dark purple hair and eyes that seem to see into other
        worlds, this AI enigma. In many ways, Dark Violet symbolizes the essence
        of women in AI—bold, curious, and unafraid to challenge conventions.
        There is something fundamentally exciting about that energy in this
        field.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's explore why experiences like mine are so crucial and what they
        mean for the bigger picture of women in AI.
      </p>
      <h3>The Current State of Affairs</h3>
      <p>
        Let's start with the numbers. There's good news – we're seeing progress!
        The World Economic Forum reports an increasing proportion of women in AI
        recently. LinkedIn data supports this, showing a significant uptick in
        women taking on AI engineering roles since 2016. However, the numbers
        are still far from balanced.
      </p>
      <p>
        Honestly, that doesn't bother me too much. It kind of makes us special,
        doesn't it? We're the cool chicks in this field. But I believe there are
        other women out there who would love AI as much as we do if they were
        introduced to everything it has to offer, especially the younger
        generations.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of 2024, women make up about 28.2% of the STEM workforce. Zooming in
        on AI specifically, the Global Gender Gap Report of 2023 puts us at
        around 30% of the AI workforce. Not bad, but there is room for
        improvement.
      </p>
      <h4>Breaking it down further:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Globally, we're looking at less than a third of the AI workforce being
          women. From the energy I saw today, this world NEEDS us, ladies.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some countries are leading the charge with higher female participation
          in AI, while others... well, let's just say they need an update.
        </li>
        <li>
          Leadership roles? That's where things get really interesting (and by
          interesting, I mean challenging). Women are even less represented in
          the upper echelons of AI.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Challenges: Because Nothing Worth Having Comes Easy</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Education and Pipeline Issues</li>
        <li>Workplace Culture</li>
        <li>Bias in AI Systems</li>
        <li>Lack of Role Models</li>
        <li>Work-Life Balance</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Why We Need Women in AI</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Diverse Perspectives</li>
        <li>Addressing Bias</li>
        <li>Economic Growth</li>
        <li>Ethical Considerations</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Cool Initiatives Making Waves</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Women of AI Groups:</strong> Remember that Women of AI meeting
          I mentioned? These groups are popping up everywhere, providing safe
          spaces for women to connect, learn, and grow in the field of AI.
          They're not just networking opportunities; they're incubators for the
          next generation of AI leaders.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>AI Skills Accelerator:</strong> The International
          Telecommunication Union (ITU) and Ernst & Young (EY) are leading the
          charge with a program aimed at training 1,000 girls across 12
          countries in AI and entrepreneurship.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Women-Led Startups:</strong> There's been a rise in support
          for women-led AI startups, with increased funding and resources.
          Investors are finally realizing that betting on women in AI is not
          just the right thing to do – it's a smart business move.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Education and Training Programs:</strong> Specialized AI
          training programs for women and girls are popping up everywhere. These
          programs offer mentorship, technical training, and networking
          opportunities, helping to bridge the gap and prepare women for stellar
          careers in AI.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mentorship Programs:</strong> Established women in AI are
          paying it forward, guiding and supporting younger professionals. It's
          like having a cool, tech-savvy big sister showing you the ropes.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Peering into the Crystal Ball (errrrm, Neural Network?)</h3>
      <p>
        The future for women in AI is looking bright, but we've still got work
        to do. Here's what we can expect:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Growing Demand:</strong> The need for AI professionals is
          skyrocketing, creating plenty of opportunities for women to enter and
          advance in the field. It's like a gold rush, but instead of pickaxes,
          we've got keyboards!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Evolving Workplace Culture:</strong> Companies are recognizing
          the value of diverse perspectives in AI development. Many are working
          to create environments where all professionals, regardless of gender,
          can contribute their best work. This includes fostering a culture of
          mutual respect and providing equal opportunities for growth and
          advancement.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Technological Advancements:</strong> As AI evolves, new roles
          are emerging that may attract more women to the field. Areas like AI
          ethics, human-centered AI design, and interdisciplinary applications
          of AI offer diverse career paths that can appeal to a wide range of
          interests and expertise.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Policy Interventions:</strong> Governments and organizations
          are implementing policies to promote equality in tech fields,
          including AI. These aim to ensure fair opportunities for all qualified
          individuals in the industry.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Wrapping It Up</h3>
      <p>
        So there you have it – the fascinating, challenging, and exciting world
        of women in AI. The good news? The future is bright, and it's ours to
        shape.
      </p>
      <p>
        My experience at the Women of AI meeting was more than just a pleasant
        surprise – it was a glimpse into what's possible when we create spaces
        that empower and celebrate women in this field. It showed me that we're
        not just making progress on paper; we're building a community, a
        movement, and a future where women don't just participate in AI but lead
        its development and direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember, every line of code you write, every algorithm you design, and
        every AI system you develop is a step towards a more inclusive,
        innovative, and awesome future.
      </p>
      <p>
        We're not just participating in the AI revolution; we're leading it, one
        neural network at a time. The future of AI NEEDS its divine feminine,
        and from what I can see, we are out here and ready to provide.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep dreaming up solutions. Keep coding those dreams. And never believe
        your imagination would give you something you cannot somehow manifest in
        this world, at least to some degree. I am still working on manifesting
        that unicorn though. Catch you on the flip side!
      </p>
      <p>
        Shout out to the great ladies from Women in AI - founders Sue Yeh
        Johnson and Becky Berry CPCC, speaker Cori Shen, and my new friends and
        colleagues Brandy Reaves and Toroko Fuwa.
