    "Read about the post-COVID societal shift towards a new normal dominated by an imbalance between the 'Capable'—those who create and solve—and the 'Administrative'—those who manipulate systems for self-benefit.",

    <React.Fragment key="on-the-coming-revolution">
      <p>
        Things are not ever returning to normal after COVID-19. Most everyone is
        saying it or thinking it. The powers that be are wondering how to
        continue to be powers that be, while most humans are clinging to hope
        that what emerges will be normal enough and generally not involve
        starvation. There is a lot at stake for how this new normal emerges, and
        humans appear to be setting themselves up for settling this the same old
        way, and that is not a good thing. But before battle lines are drawn
        between red and blue, blue and grey, left and right, black and white,
        East and West, left and right, or any other combination of opposites, I
        want to draw my own lines. This is probably going to be the most
        apolitical call to arms that you have ever read, for political positions
        are completely irrelevant at this point.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here’s the thing. I love human beings. I don’t always love being around
        them, but I do love the art that is the human persona. I especially love
        and respect capable humans who find remarkable ways to overcome
        problems, big or small, personal or professional.
      </p>

      <p>
        This admiration has led me to notice some things. Society has polarized
        itself in a manner that is not at all obvious to most, and deserves
        careful consideration, for it seems as though there is a type of human
        that has found its way into positions of power at all levels in our
        society, and that type of human is simply inadequate for such a job.
        They are not at all the capable human being that I describe above.
      </p>

      <p>
        So I am going to assert that the revolution that leads to a permanently
        new normal will ultimately come down to what I will call the Capable
        against the Administrative, resulting in an inversion of these two in
        terms of the social structures that evolve out of this.
      </p>

      <h2>The Capable know how to do things.</h2>

      <p>
        The Administrative know how organizations are run. More importantly, The
        Administrative know how to run organizations in manners that benefit
        themselves or other members of the Administrative class above all
        others, often at the expense of the capable.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Administrative are the ones who come up with new cost cutting
        measures, while capable are the ones who know how to invent, make,
        build, or create things that have value.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Administrative know how to extract that value while convincing the
        Capable that they are not the reason the value was created.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yes, my view is jaded and cynical, but I have grown up in this world, in
        this time. My first job was at a pizza place, where I discretely
        observed the manager embezzling money. So I carefully hid the evidence
        so that he could be taken down. And he was, and shortly thereafter I was
        sexually harassed by the next manager. I could make pizzas 5X faster
        than either of them, and I was paid less than a fifth of what they made.
      </p>

      <p>
        I experienced grad school and saw the abuse of hard working 20
        somethings in their prime who had been convinced that they were there to
        “learn” and so their labor was not of value, even though it was the best
        such labor in the world. Many were the top 0.1% in terms of capability.
        While their professors were grant writers and administrators whose
        contributions to the effectiveness of science could be held in question.
        This situation has worsened over the 20 years since I left graduate
        school.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, I know it seems like the professors should be considered to be part
        of the capable class. And yet, they have found themselves in service to
        a much less capable administrative class, which has apparently
        integrated the professors with minimal resistance. And they did this
        while the administrative class devised a means to amass great wealth and
        power by putting an entire generation in debt for something that was
        essentially free to the previous generations. This required the
        coordinated effort of The Administrative operating in our Congress, our
        banking industry, and our academic institutions. I am not suggesting
        conspiracy, I am saying that the Administrative is always naturally
        cooperative in situations that result in a win-win-win for multiple
        powerful parties.
      </p>

      <p>
        My first job out of grad school was at a massive industrial research lab
        of much renown, and there I participated in the telecom boom and bust.
        This was an entirely artificial economic calamity created by lying
        administrators at Worldcom. I sat in wonder at optical conferences where
        Enron suddenly shows up as a player in the telecom markets, and nobody
        knew why. Ultimately the CEO at my company was let go with a payment
        that was 1000X my salary, and replaced with an ill qualified
        administrator who was paid even more than that to run the company
        completely into the ground.
      </p>

      <p>
        So I do have a personal perspective on this. I admit that my youthful
        vigor wanted to join the administrative party. I wanted to be one of the
        ones who turned around and received gifts of millions for abject failure
        while landing my next board of directors position. But deep down, I knew
        I could never actually be THAT.
      </p>

      <p>
        But do not confuse this with simple grousing about unfulfilled
        potential. What I am describing is a real problem and a real imbalance,
        and it threatens the life of humans more than any other. Because capable
        humans are great and can accomplish anything, but currently they are
        being ground to dust by the Administrative class. Not in the sense of
        Fritz Lang's Metropolis, though that is still part of the problem in
        parts of the world, but in the manner in which those who produce value
        have that value proportionally extracted from them by those who do not,
        or more precisely, cannot, produce value. This is the ultimate
        deprivation of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, for the
        things that a person spends time doing is their life at the time they
        are doing it. When that life force is being systematically diverted for
        nefarious purposes that will never benefit the aims of the individual
        who contributed that life force, there is some amount of enslavement
        happening.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am not saying the everybody is underpaid or under-appreciated. Like
        most revolutions, the opposing parties constitute a small fraction of
        the populace. There are many people who are neither administrative nor
        capable. But without question, The Capable know better how to get value
        from these people than The Administrative ever have or will.
      </p>

      <p>
        Capable humans need administrators assisting them in their efforts.
        There is no doubt about this. That would be the balanced order of
        things. For in such an instance, the administrative become capable.
      </p>

      <p>
        But this is not the current situation. The corrupted systems of the
        world have been created and established as a means of self-perpetuation
        that can only be achieved through an administrative class that seeks to
        reward itself using structures that take value away from The Capable
        class.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not everything that the administrative class does in order to amass
        wealth and power is illegal. It doesn’t have to be, because the
        administrative class is truly gifted in its ability to manipulate other
        administrative systems to their own benefit. In particular, the legal
        system and its close relative the tax system are run by The
        Administrative class for the benefit of The Administrative class at the
        expense of The Capable.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since I am writing this for The Capable class, I will throw in a
        mathematical concept. If the rate of growth of a value, say x, is
        proportional to the value of x, we call that an exponential process. It
        grows without limit, and the more it grows, the faster it grows. This is
        the exact situation that we currently find ourselves in with regard to
        The Administrative. Because of the overt effects that the administrative
        have on the legal and tax systems, they are able to increase their
        influence, and as their influence increases, they are able to further
        manipulate these systems. This is an unstable system. This is a runaway
        exponential process that favors no living humans in the long run, not
        even the short-sighted Administrative humanoids.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Capable look at the world today and say “I remember a time when
        things were different, and everyone agreed they should be better, and
        yet they got worse.” This is not the sort of result that makes sense to
        a Capable person. A Capable person sees a problem, and then works on it
        until it gets better.
      </p>

      <p>
        But in their respective roles, The Administrative will see a problem and
        consider it only in terms of how any sort of movement on the problem,
        including making it worse, can result in outcomes that benefit the
        Administrator or his or her comrades.
      </p>

      <p>
        I can be a little more concrete, and I want to make clear that I am not
        drawing lines between wealth classes. There are extremely Capable people
        among the very wealthy, and there are extremely Administrative people
        among the impoverished.
      </p>

      <p>
        The capable want to make things that work, or do things that result in
        positive outcomes, and they have the mindset and the problem solving
        skills that give them the ability to do this. They are the ones that
        make this world run. They invent when they need to invent, and they work
        hard when they need to work hard.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the administrative is driven by something else. Take, for example,
        an extremely hard working and talented individual who gets promoted to
        the first level of management. A capable person within a management team
        can be a good thing to have, but if her inclinations remain aligned with
        her former colleagues, she will find her career path ultimately stifled.
        For instance, supposes she sees that the true value of her organization
        is being generated by the production staff and that this should put a
        cap on the administrative salaries or bonuses in the company. In doing
        so she will have set herself up in opposition to the Administrative, and
        she won’t be allowed into that club.
      </p>

      <p>
        In every company that has moved production overseas to save cost, lone
        voices spoke out in favor of a greater vision, and when these voices
        were not ignored, they were legally silenced. Because at this point,
        every company knows that its CEO, Chairman, and board can all be
        replaced rapidly if choices to cut costs are not made swiftly and
        decisively. They can even be sued by disgruntled shareholders. The
        Administrative demeanor is demanded by the systems the Administrative
        has created.
      </p>

      <p>
        And at the same time we have the administrative working at the top of
        our labor unions, bargaining for their own power, and using
        administrative manipulations to render systems unworkable. When the
        Administrative clash with the Administrative, then the Administrative
        always wins, even if the clash would appear to be on behalf of the
        Capable.
      </p>

      <p>
        The main reason for this is that there is an arm of the administrative
        that extends into, and mostly claims, the legal system and its
        participants, lawyers and judges. Lawyers make money whenever there is a
        legal action. Those who are very good at winning legal actions make more
        money. So they may be considered capable. But the Administrative creeps
        into this due to this thing called common law. There are really good
        lawyers who operate in order to write common law into existence through
        their expert manipulations of the legal system. This means they pursue
        and win cases that establish the legal precedences that their
        Administrative colleagues can use to advance their own agendas. Note
        that this is is a legal process that sidesteps all aspects of democracy,
        and yet it defines much of the law in many nations.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are lawyers who specialize in helping white collar criminals, and
        these lawyers are many times more effective than the ones who attempt to
        prosecute white collar criminals. White collar crime by the
        Administrative offers big payoffs. It is nearly always a winning
        proposition. The bigger the crime, the bigger the win, usually.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Administrative are deeply involved in our medical system. In fact,
        the notion of a for-profit insurance company is Administrative at its
        core. Capable people may agree to a co-operative method of underwriting
        risk amongst a group or a community, but the notion of actively giving
        hard earned money to people who are going to end up with much more money
        than you just so that you don't have to fear the unknown would usually
        be considered a cult scam. There is no reason whatsoever that it has to
        be this way, except for the intention on the part of the The
        Administrative to make sure this system remains in place.
      </p>

      <p>
        And insurance companies have used administrative manipulations to
        establish their hold on the entire legal system. We don't have many
        discussions in the United States about health care costs. We only
        discuss health insurance.
      </p>

      <p>
        What could happen if the Capable just took over this system right now.
        What if they did something crazy like burned all of the common law and
        shut down all of the insurance companies. They could make it so that
        every person was responsible for their own health outcomes, as opposed
        to the doctors who took care of them. In other words, they could get rid
        of medical malpractice lawsuits as a viable means of controlling the
        quality of our healthcare system. Instead, we could rely on public
        rating systems and transparency into all hospital operations using
        technologies that are already prevalent in our society. By then, we will
        have eliminated more than 90% of the overhead of our current medical
        system. This is the point where we can then start to talk about who pays
        for it, and also how to establish effective deterrents to medical
        malpractice that do not result in an economic instability that serves
        the Administrative class. The Capable may come to the conclusion that
        everyone could actually pay for much of their own, as the above changes
        would also motivate the rise of true health, not just medicine, but
        actual understanding of health and optimum conditions for human life.
      </p>

      <p>
        This process will reveal that the Administrative have been in charge of
        generating a food supply for our country that is responsible for a very
        large fraction of our health problems. The capable would see this and
        recognize that we only need to educate people while developing ways to
        give them what they crave without the use of chemicals that are
        literally guaranteed, for example, to bring about morbid obesity in
        particular gene types, or diabetes in others.
      </p>

      <p>
        In very little time, we could reduce our total healthcare costs to be
        pennies on the dollar to what they are now, even with a free market
        system and no insurers. At this point, the problem becomes much more
        tractable for capable people to solve.
      </p>

      <p>
        We also can't leave out the other key administrative arm that makes
        these things work: public relations. Capable people rely upon truth and
        integrity. The administrative are not so bound, and when they feel the
        need to stretch truth 'legally' in a manner that can bend the psyche of
        the populace, they turn to PR. There are certainly capable people at PR
        firms, but the administrative is the power behind the calculations that
        say spending $100M in order to convince a population of a falsehood that
        will result in people paying $10B is always a good choice to make. This
        even happens in medicine, where companies have literally launched
        campaigns to excessively demonize necessary nutrients that our bodies
        produce, all so they can sell billions of dollars of rather harmful
        medicines.
      </p>

      <p>
        One thing is clear at this point, and that is the Capable do have to
        rise up and assert themselves as the leaders and the decision makers
        that result in the outcomes that will make tomorrow a thriving world.
        Politics is irrelevant. This government that we currently have is
        irrelevant. The next moment is the only thing that is truly real, and it
        is time for these structures to topple, and for a new structure to be
        built in its place. And I beseech The Capable, the hard working, the
        quiet ones who have long held this world together, to no longer tolerate
        any aspect of the Administrative. Human beings are better than this, and
        you, Capable one, have to climb out of the hole that you've let be
        defined for you by the Administrative and actually realize that you are
        the one with the power and the strength to bring about a golden age of
        humanity and the earth at large.
