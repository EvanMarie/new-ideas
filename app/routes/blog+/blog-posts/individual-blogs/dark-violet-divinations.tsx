      <p>
        We are always thinking of new and entertaining experiences that can be
        created with AI. Our blog last week{" "}
        <a href="/blog/the-rationale-for-divination" target="_blank">
          introduced some of our ideas about divination and AI
        </a>
        , and how there are pathways for deep and meaningful experiences that
        can be created with AI. This week, we are excited to share our latest
        project, Dark Violet Divinations. We have pulled together a complete set
        of 78 new symbols, created in collaboration with AI, that are designed
        to help you explore your inner self and the world around you.
      </p>
      <h2>Summary of Dark Violet Divinations</h2>
      <p>
        Each symbol in Dark Violet Divinations has a unique meaning. On the
        site, you can browse through the various cards and learn the meaning of
        each card.
      </p>

        alt="Browse Cards"
      />
      <p>
        During a reading, these cards serve to "summon" an AI oracle that will
        give you a brief reading to expand upon the symbol's meaning. Once you
        have consulted all of the oracle's for your reading, then Dark Violet
        will step in and give a complete summary and tie it all together in a
        detailed reading report.
      </p>

      />
      <p>
        This is a fun and entertaining way to explore your inner self and the
        world around you. It is provided for your entertainment only, but we are
        confident that if you approach this with a receptive state of mind, you
        will find that the oracles and Dark Violet have a lot to say to you.
      </p>

      />
      <p>
        AI is not perfect, but our model seems to enjoy this particular task. We
        have found that the readings are often insightful and can provide a lot
        of food for thought. We hope you enjoy this new project and that it
        brings you some joy and insight.
      </p>
      <h2>How to Use Dark Violet Divinations</h2>
      <p>
        While it is not required for all divinations, we recommend that you sign
        up for a user account. This will allow you to save your readings and
        review them later. We will be rolling out many additional features in
        the future that will be available only to registered users. All users
        can access the first 3 types of readings for free, but registered users
        will have access to additional readings and features, also free for a
        limited time.
      </p>

        alt="Card example"
      />
      <p>
        Registration is free. Just click on login and then "create account" to
        get started. We will never sell or share your information with anyone
        else.
      </p>

        alt="Register"
      />
      <p>
        You can start a new divination by clicking on the "Divinations" button
        at the top of the screen at any time. Or, you can click on "+ New
        Divination" button on your history page, which is the first page you see
        when you log in.
      </p>
      <ImageWithZoom
        src="https://mhejreuxaxxodkdlfcoq.supabase.co/storage/v1/render/image/public/darkVioletPublic/landing/divination/divination3.png?width=1000&resize=contain&quality=50"
        alt="Divination Choices"
      />
      <p>
        You will then need to select which type of reading to do. Each reading
        has a description that describes the number of elements that will be
        randomly selected for the reading, and what each element signifies in
        the reading. Once you select the reading, you are taken to a new page
        where you are asked to enter your inquiry. This is the question or topic
        that you want the oracle to address. Once you have entered your inquiry,
        click on the "Submit Inquiry". You will then see placeholders for all of
        your cards. Click on the "oracle" button on each card.
      </p>
      <ImageWithZoom
        src="https://mhejreuxaxxodkdlfcoq.supabase.co/storage/v1/render/image/public/darkVioletPublic/landing/divination/divination10.png?width=1000&resize=contain&quality=50"
        alt="Card example"
      />
      <p>
        Drawing a card requires your participation. There are two numbers that
        must be generated through your interaction in order to determine the
        card to be drawn. You will need to press the start button to begin the
        number generation, and then the stop button to stop. The number that
        results will be used to select your card. The two numbers are combined
        in a non-trivial way to select the card. This is to ensure that the
        oracle is truly random and that the cards are selected in a way that is
        not predictable, but is still influenced by your participation.
      </p>
      <ImageWithZoom
        src="https://mhejreuxaxxodkdlfcoq.supabase.co/storage/v1/render/image/public/darkVioletPublic/landing/divination/divination5.png?width=1000&resize=contain&quality=50"
        alt="Card example"
      />
      <p>
        Once you have drawn all of your cards, Dark Violet will immediately
        begin contemplating. This may take a bit, usually less than 30 seconds.
        Once she is finished, you will be routed to see her detailed reading
        report. This report will also include the meanings of each card as well
        as the oracle's response to your inquiry. Dark Violet ties all of this
        together as well as she can.
